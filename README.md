Search for Python 3 compatible packages which are Idle in PortingDB.
If you find some package with this tool:

* Check, if it is really Python 3 compatible.
* If it is light gray (Idle) in PortingDB: 
  * Look at Bugzilla, if there is already a reported "Provide Python 3 subpackage" or "New version release" bug.
    * If there is a bug, make it Blocks #1285816.
    * If there is no bug read this: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pviktori/Python_3_Bug_Filing and fill the bug! :)
* If it is red (Blocked) in PortingDB, continue there: Investigate & Annotate > But it is Python 3 compatible upstream! > Blocked packages http://fedora.portingdb.xyz/howto/#investigate-annotate
